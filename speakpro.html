        <h2> Project Overview </h2>
        <div> <!-- Column 1: text -->
          <p> Speaking with confidence is a valued skill among many professions. Individuals often do not have a convenient way to connect with an industry-specific expert in vocal coaching. </p>
          <p> <b> Challenge: </b> Design an app that enables users to easily identify a coach who can meet their unique needs and allows them to schedule a remote coaching session.

            <h3> Defining The Problems to be Solved </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Users need help preparing for events (auditions, presentations) but don't know where to look</li>
              <li>Preference for the convenience of an e-learning/remote coaching environment</li>
              <li>Difficulty evaluating the quality of coaches online </li>
            </ul>
            <p> <b>Problem Statement</b>: Users need a way to quickly find the right coach with whom they can develop confidence and hone skills. </p>
            <p> I proposed these solutions: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The SpeakPRO app will empower users to search for experts and make informed choices about which coach to engage</li>
              <li>Users will be able to find coaches that meet their unique scheduling needs </li>
            </ul>

            <h3> Competitive Analysis, Business Objectives & Scope </h3>
            <p> Next, I assessed the landscape of the online coaching market geared specifically toward vocal/speech support and identified two competitors: Acting.pro and TakeLessons. For each company I analyzed:
            <ul>
              <li> Overall Strategy </li>
              <li> Key Features </li>
              <li> Marketing Profile </li>
            </ul>
            <p> This exercise culminated in a SWOT analysis of each competitor, which provided the context to define SpeakPRO's target audience, SMART goals, and functional requirements. </p>

        <div> <!-- Row 1 -->
          <div> <!-- Column 1 -->
            <h3> Interviews </h3>
            <p> To better understand users' needs and goals, I conducted a series of moderated interviews with participants from my target demographic. The script included questions about past experience with similar products, specific situations that would require use of the product, and the desirability of particular app features. From these interviews, I distilled: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>users' behaviors & attitudes</li>
              <li>revealing quotes</li>
              <li> needs </li>
              <li> pain points </li>
            </ul>
            <h3> User Personas </h3>
            <p> Using the insights gleaned from the interviews, I created user personas that represented the core SpeakPRO users. I consistently referred back to these documents throughout my work on the project to remain connected to the most important characteristics and needs of my users. </p>

            <p> I created these documents to transition between user research and building the information architecture for the product. These exercises allowed me to understand exactly how and why users would be using SpeakPRO within narrowly defined use cases/scenarios, and what they would be thinking and feeling at each step of their process.  </p>

            <h3> IA & Sitemap </h3>
            <p> The design phase began with an initial draft of the sitemap. I then used a cardsorting activity with participants to explore where users expected to see particular content on the site, and revised the sitemap based on those insights. </p>
            <h3> Low > Mid Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p> To plan the general layout, navigation patterns, and core interaction elements of the web app, I began with pencil/paper sketches of both mobile and desktop views and did several rounds of rapid iteration. To get initial user feedback on the flow of MVP features (profile customization, coach database searching, and booking a session) I transitioned my designs into a mid-fidelity clickable prototype using Balsamiq & Invision. </p>

            <h3> Methodology </h3>
            <p> The usability study consisted of moderated, in-person tests of the mobile version of SpeakPRO. These tests included a short briefing, two basic task flows (edit profile and book a coach), and a satisfaction survey. I used the Lookback platform to capture screen recordings and audio/video of the participants. I adhered to ethical research practices, including responsible recruiting, and use of consent forms. </p>
            <h3> Script </h3>
            <p> I developed a testing script to provide structure and cohesion to each session. Each participant was asked background and open-ended questions before beginning the required tasks. Each task was assigned within specific scenarios to provide relevant context. </p>

            <h3> Discoveries </h3>
            <p> After collecting and coding all interview data, I sorted these findings into 4 categories: errors, observations, positive quotes, and negative quotes. Using Nielsen's scale for rating the severity of usability problems, I identified 5 of the most frequently reported issues and triaged them as low/medium/high priority updates, and proposed potential design changes. </p>

            <h3> Visual Design Principles </h3>
            <p> Establishing clear, consistent UI elements was the priority for the high-fidelity versions of SpeakPRO's wireframes. In creating these elements I considered: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Gestalt theory</li>
              <li>Emotional design for user engagement </li>
              <li> Grid layouts </li>
            </ul>
            <p> As I applied the final design touches to the app, I also assembled a style guide and other design documentation to help preserve consistency.  </p>

            <h3> Accessibility Audit </h3>
            <p> I examined all of SpeakPRO’s user flows and features to make sure the design was as inclusive as possible. The decision to avoid splashy or colorful backdrops and keep the background white means that color contrast and readability is optimized. I revised several of SpeakPRO's icons (especially CTAs) to incorporate text labels that would be more easily detected by screen readers. I tried to reduce cognitive load for users as much as possible by providing clear/concise language cues and following expected conventions. The app follows WCAG guidelines to create content that is: </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Perceivable </li>
              <li> Operable </li>
              <li> Understandable </li>
              <li> Robust </li>
            </ul>

        <div> <!-- Row 1 -->
          <div> <!-- Column 1 -->
            <p> The low-fidelity prototypes did not allow for sorting functionality on the coaches results page. This was changed to allow sorting of the results by rating, price, and availability - something in which users expressed strong interest. Early versions of SpeakPRO also included flows that required users to follow a rigid series of steps when booking a coach. They had to start by selecting a date, then a time, then providing payment info. The updated prototype gives the user flexibility to customize the booking process, and even provides helpful hints in which flow might work best for the user’s particular needs. </p>
            <p> All of these changes were made to give the user more control in the process of finding and booking a coach. They resulted from careful consideration of users’ needs and feedback expressed at every stage of the design process. </p>
